## Overview
### Description
Tunes with Friends is a social networking app designed to connect Spotify users with similar music taste.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** For the past decade, social networking has been a mobile-first experience. This app will integrate audio samples of songs and location services to fetch nearby concerts.
- **Story:** Music lovers have yet to be served by an interactive social experience. The Spotify app does not actively make its social features visible on mobile, nor promote connection with other users.
- **Market:** This app's target user base is devoted music fans who would like to connect with others who share their passion for music. They listen frequently, like discovering new music, and may attend their favorite artists' concerts.
- **Habit:** This app's average usage varies by user, ranging from daily use by the most devoted music lovers to weekly or less frequent usage by more casual music fans. Devoted music fans are likely to post often, whereas causal users may post infrquently or not at all.
- **Scope:** The most technically challenging aspect of this app is building interactive features, such as song samples from the Spotify API and sharing lyrics snippets from a separate lyrics API.
